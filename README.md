# Basic-Portfolio

This is a template for basic portfolio website.
So far, the site is static, built with HTML and CSS files.

Feel free to fork and re-use:

`git clone https://github.com/Meggin/Basic-Portfolio.git`

## A word of caution

I'm learning the fundamentals of writing CSS,
so you will notice I'm not using [https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/](flexbox) yet,
sticking to floats and positioning for now.

Stay tuned, as the hope is I will get better!
